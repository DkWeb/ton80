Ton 80
======

Ton 80 is a benchmark suite for Dart. The Dart team continuously monitors
the performance of these benchmarks: http://dartlang.org/performance/.

In it's current setup, the Ton80 benchmark suite is easy to run and
profile from the command line. When adding new benchmarks to the suite, 
please use the existing harness and help us make sure we can continue to
easily run and profile from the command line.
